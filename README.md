# Malware-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning

Project Overview: 
The Malware Detection System with Machine Learning is a software development for detecting malicious file in a computer system. User can use this software to detect malware from the executable files used in the computer. To develop this system, we took a dataset consisting of 138,047 files where 96,724 were malware files and 41,323 were non-malware files. Then we divided the data into training and testing set. The Extra-trees Classisifer model is used to optimize the training dataset and Random Forest Classifier model is used to best-fit the model with the optimized dataset. The model has 99.98% training accuracy and 99.50% testing accuracy. The modelâ€™s performance is far better than the Gradient Boosting Classifier model and Decision Tree Classifier model which gave training accuracy 98.84%, 98.74% and testing accuracy 99.99% and 99.20% respectively. The software extracts file metadata and process with the Random Forest Classifier model. Through these processes, the software predicts whether the executable file is a malicious file or not. We have developed our system using Python programming language.  

Model Training & Prediction:
1. To train the model, two classifier algorithms, Extra-tree and Random-forest were used.

2. To predict wheter a file is malware or not, it's metadata are extracted and given to the model to make the prediction.

2. The metadata of the file are extracted.

3. The model makes prediction upon the given metadata.
